## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.


# ToDo App
This is a simple ToDo app built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The app allows users to add, delete and update tasks. It also allows users to filter their tasks based on their completion status.

# Getting Started
To run the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

# Features

## Add Tasks
Users can add new tasks by typing in the task name in the input field and pressing the 'Enter' key or clicking the 'Add' button. The task is added to the top of the list.

## Delete Tasks
Users can delete tasks by clicking the 'X' icon beside each task.

## Complete Tasks
Users can mark tasks as complete by clicking the checkbox beside each task. Completed tasks are moved to the bottom of the list and are displayed with a strikethrough.

## Update Tasks
Users can update a task by double-clicking on it. This will change the task into an editable input field. Users can then update the task by typing in the new task name and pressing the 'Enter' key.

## Filter Tasks
Users can filter their tasks based on their completion status. They can choose to view all tasks, active tasks, or completed tasks. The filter buttons are located at the bottom left corner of the app.

## Item Count
The app displays the total number of items in the list and the number of active items.

## Clear Completed Tasks
Users can clear all completed tasks by clicking the 'Clear Completed' button. This removes all completed tasks from the list.

## Dark Theme
The app has a dark theme that can be toggled on and off by clicking the sun/moon icon at the top right corner of the app.

## Drag and Drop
The user can drag and drop todo items to rearrange their order.

## Technical Details
The app uses local storage to store the tasks. This means that the tasks are not lost when the user closes the app. The app also uses drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to rearrange the order of the tasks. The app is responsive and can be used on mobile and desktop devices.
